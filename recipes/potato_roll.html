      Where ordinary wheat buns should be left at the door for these delights
    </h2>
    <p>
      Burgers, the all time treat we find ourselves going back to. But one thing
      that can spoil the event is a bland, stale, boring bun. It is time we put
      aside the disappointing wheat buns, and adopt
      <strong>the potato</strong>, and this recipe is going to show exactly how
      we can do that.
    </p>
    <h2>Things you need:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>125g warm water (86F/30C)</li>
      <li>3g or 1tsp yeast</li>
      <li>45g or 3 tbsp melted butter</li>
      <li>75g or 1/3c mashed potato</li>
      <li>35g or 2 3/4 tbsp sugar</li>
      <li>300g or 1 3/4c ap flour (11.7% protein)</li>
      <li>5g or 1tsp salt</li>
      <li>egg wash (1 egg + 2 teas water, stirred)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Make that potato roll:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with dough hook attachment,
        measure water, yeast, melted butter, mashed potato, sugar, flour, salt.
        Mix on low for 3 mins until combined. Increase speed to med-high and mix
        5-6 more mins. Cover & allow to ferment at room temperature for 90
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        After that 90 mins, flip out dough onto a lightly floured work surface.
        Divide dough into six 100g pieces. Fold and shape each of the 6 pieces
        as shown @2:58. Place on a sheet tray lined with a piece of oiled
        parchment, cover, and proof at room temp for 45-60 min.
      </li>
      <li>
        Brush each dough ball with egg wash & load into preheated 400F/204C oven
        for 15min or until deep golden brown.
