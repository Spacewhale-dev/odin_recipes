    <h2>What's in a cheesecake?</h2>
    <p>
      Do you know the saying 'what makes a good baked product?' is a whole lot
      of love, and especially lard. This cheesecake captures the essence of
      delighting your tastebuds while straining those heart muscles. Devour with
      caution...
    </p>
    <h2>Things you need:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>375g (3 8-packs) GRAHAM CRACKERS</li>
      <li>110g or 1c walnuts, toasted</li>
      <li>40g or 1/4c sugar</li>
      <li>3g or 2/3tsp salt</li>
      <li>30g or 1/4c flour</li>
      <li>170g (1.5 sticks) butter, melted</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Make that Graham-Cracker crust</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Add ingredients except for butter to a food processor and spin until
        broken down into a sandy texture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drizzle in butter while spinning. When ready, it should be able to hold
        itself together when you squeeze it. If it’s still crumbly, spin in a
        bit more butter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread into a greased 9” springform pan by pressing 50-60% of the graham
        cracker mixture evenly against the sides. See video @2:10 for method.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add remaining crumbs into the pan and press into an even layer on the
        bottom of the pan.
      </li>
      <li>Par bake at 350F/175C for 10 minutes</li>
    </ol>
