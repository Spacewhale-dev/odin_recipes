    <h1>Succulent and Rich Cheddar Broccoli Soup</h1>

    <p>
      People always say they don't enjoy their vegetables. This is why one
      should cover that stuff in a rich, creamy and dreamy, cheddar cheese
      enriched soup broth. It makes a world of a difference.
    </p>

    <h2>Things you need:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>350g or 1 large white onion, small diced</li>
      <li>125g or 1 small bulb fennel, small diced</li>
      <li>20g or 6 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>125g or 1 large carrot, medium diced</li>
      <li>250g or 2 small yukon gold potatoes, medium diced</li>
      <li>375-400g or 3-4 small heads broccoli, medium diced</li>
      <li>75g or 1/3c olive oil</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>50g or 1/3c flour (gluten free flour works too)</li>
      <li>1500g or 6 C. chicken stock</li>
      <li>250g or 1c heavy cream</li>
      <li>225g or about 1 3/4c - 1 7/8c cheddar cheese (shredded)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Make that cheesy broccoli soup:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat large pot over med-high heat. Add oil. Add vegetables and a
        pinch of salt. Stir. Sweat veg for 6-8 mins. Once beginning to soften,
        add flour. Stir to coat veg and cook for a couple of minutes, just to
        cook off the raw edge, before adding in chicken stock and cream. Stir,
        reduce heat to med-low and continue to cook for 10min.
      </li>
      <li>
        When veggies are tender, but not mushy, reduce heat to low. Scoop about
        3-4c of soup into a tall sided sauce pot and blend with immersion
        blender (or blend with standard blender). Add blended soup back into the
        original soup pot and stir. Stir in cheese. Taste for seasoning. I
        typically add an additional pinch of salt or two.
      </li>
      <li>
        Garnish with black pepper and an additional pinch of shredded cheese!
      </li>
    </ol>
